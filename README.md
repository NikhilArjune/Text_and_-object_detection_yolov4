# Text_and_-object_detection_yolov4
This project implements real-time text and object detection using YOLOv4 and OpenCV. Designed for efficient image analysis, the model allows users to input image URLs, download the images, and perform independent detections of both text regions and objects.

## **Features**

## Text Detection: 
Identifies and highlights regions containing text within images, providing bounding box coordinates and area calculations.

## Object Detection: Detects and categorizes objects in real-time from image URLs, optimized for low-latency applications such as surveillance and autonomous systems.
User-Friendly Input: Accepts image URLs as input for seamless processing.
Technical Details

## YOLOv4: Utilized for object detection due to its balance of speed and accuracy.

## OpenCV: Integrated for image preprocessing and additional support for bounding box visualization.

## Setup
Instructions for setting up the environment and dependencies are provided in the README file.

## Applications

Ideal for projects requiring robust text and object recognition without reliance on external APIs, with potential applications in image analysis, security, and automated monitoring systems.
